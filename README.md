## About

A browser implementation of the classic **Flying Windows** Screensaver that used to be available in
various versions of Windows during the 90s. While it no longer seems to be bundled with the OS, it
can at least now live on in our hearts (or the very least, in our browsers).


## Languages

Currently this has been implemented in

* [X] Rust
* [X] JavaScript
* []  And more....?

Feel free to contribute an implementation in your `$FAVORITE_LANGUAGE` if it is not currently here.
Hopefully this can be used as a reference to see how various languages interact with the HTML5 canvas.

Please note that `wasm-pack` is needed for Rust.

## Random Musings

1. Despite being a Windows Screensaver, this was implemented on Ubuntu Linux.
    * This has only been tested on Mozilla Firefox. If contributing to this repo, please make sure that
    the example can run on said browser.

2. Please note that this is not a perfect re-implementation, it is just an approximation.
